1. Make another Sequelize model called Provider. (You'll have to import it in src/index.js for it to get run). 
2. Add a foreign key to Patient pointing to provider. 

run \d+ "Patients"    to see if it actually runs.

3. Add a Food model with the appropriate foreign keys.
4. Add a Weight table with the appropriate foreign keys. 

(If at this name you start to get annoyed by the table names, Sequelize.define() takes 
 a second argument called options which has a tableName attribute which you can define
 to your liking.)

5. Make sure the database matches the diagram we drew. At this point you're ready to 
   move on to migrations. That's the task for next week.
